# Is_It_Tuesday_Yet
An open-sourced iPhone app that determines with near 100% accuracy if the current day of the week is Tuesday.

Written using Swift, and testing on a iPhone 7.  I have unfortunately not been able to properly test this application, as my schedule on Tuesdays has been relatively busy.
